International Shipping — Key Concepts:

Incoterms 2020:
Incoterms define responsibilities between buyer and seller for cost, risk, and insurance.
- EXW (Ex Works): Seller packs goods at their premises; buyer bears all costs and risks.
- FOB (Free On Board): Seller delivers goods on board the vessel at the port of shipment.
- CIF (Cost Insurance Freight): Seller pays freight and insurance to destination port.
- DAP (Delivered at Place): Seller delivers to named place; buyer handles import customs.
- DDP (Delivered Duty Paid): Seller handles everything including import duties.
Recommendation for Indian exporters: FOB or CIF are most commonly used.

Modes of Shipment:
1. Sea Freight:
   - FCL (Full Container Load): Best for large volumes. Standard containers: 20ft, 40ft, 40ft HC.
   - LCL (Less than Container Load): For smaller shipments; consolidated with other cargo.
   - Transit times: India to Europe: 18–25 days; India to USA: 20–30 days; India to UAE: 5–7 days.

2. Air Freight:
   - Faster (2–7 days) but significantly more expensive.
   - Best for: high-value, time-sensitive, perishable goods.

3. Courier / Express:
   - DHL, FedEx, UPS for small shipments (typically <70 kg).

Key Indian Ports:
- Nhava Sheva (JNPT), Mumbai — Largest container port.
- Mundra Port, Gujarat — Second largest, well-connected to industrial hubs.
- Chennai Port — Major port for southern India.
- Kolkata / Haldia — Eastern India.

Shipping Documents:
- Bill of Lading (B/L): Issued by shipping line; title document for goods.
- Airway Bill (AWB): For air freight; non-negotiable.
- Freight Invoice: Charges for transportation.
- Insurance Certificate: Required under CIF terms.

INCOTERMS Impact on Customs Value:
- CIF value (Cost + Insurance + Freight) is used as the basis for import duty calculation in India and most countries.
